# MaxBot 🤖🏥

## Features ✨

- Chat with MaxBot regarding your health and symptoms.
- Get curated doctor recommendations based on your symptoms and location (NOTE: The dataset for doctors in MaxBot is NOT REAL and very limited. As this was made for a hackathon, I don't necessarily plan on expanding it either)

## Built With 🛠
